# tweet-card

This project involves the following features:

When the user clicks on the element that will receive input from the user, the color of the placeholder changes. When clicked elsewhere, it reverts to its original color.

If the tweet is empty, the button remains inactive.

When the user starts typing a tweet, the placeholder disappears.

A character counter appears next to the button, and it decreases as the user enters a tweet.

When the character limit is exceeded, the color of the character counter turns red, and the tweet button becomes inactive.

Characters that exceed the limit have a red background color.
